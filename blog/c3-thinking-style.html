          <p>When I started blogging back in 2001 or so, at the young age of 13, tests--personality tests, IQ tests, behavioral assessments, Which-90's-Band-Are-You-? tests--were all the rage. There were so many of them, and each test claimed to be able to reveal more about myself then even I knew. My spiritual color is yellow, you say? Oh, that means that I am a person with a happy disposition blah blah blah...</p>

          <p>I tell you this so you can understand that I was a little reluctant to take *gasp!* even more such tests as part of my first foray into Dev Bootcamp</p>

          <p>I realize now that the important distinction that I did not make when I was much younger--other than the fact that a lot of those tests for bloggers were not at all scientifically backed--is that these tests were never designed to cover the entire spectrum of a person. People are simply too complex to be categorized so easily. Rather, such tests are meant to serve more as a guide, to help you figure out things like how you might learn better (as is the case here).</p>

          <p>Note, for example, the photo above. Anthony Gregorc would classify me as a Concrete Random, according to the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Mind Styles model</a> that he created. I read through the list, and yeah, that sounds exactly like how I learn best. At the encouragement of Dev Bootcamp, I thought that I should really think about the implications of results like this more. How does this apply to me exactly? How can I utilize this knowledge to aid me in my learning?</p>

          <p>I think about how I've tackled my experience with DBC so far, and this lists confirms to me that I have been confronting it the right way--with lots of experimentation, trial-and-error and a healthy dose of intuition and alone time. It doesn't hurt that there is a bit of classroom environment at DBC as well, however unconventional it might be.</p>

          <p>In terms of avoiding factors that make learning challenging for me, well...I've always known that I've greatly disliked having to redo things. I guess the solution there is just to learn something or do something well enough the first time, so that I don't have to do it again. There are so many ways that I can use such results as a guide to aid me in my learning.</p>

          <p>However, the test that really hit home was not the Mind Styles test, which only really told me things I already knew and was willing to admit to myself. Rather, the test that made an impact was having to categorize myself with a <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Fixed vs. Growth Mindset.</a> It isn't your usual test--you don't tick boxes, or circle answers, or pick the photo that you find most compelling. In this test, you read through a list and figure out for yourself which camp you belong to based on the descriptions.</p>

          <p>It pained me to note that I was more often than not in the Fixed Mindset camp.</p>

          <p>Fortuntely, with this knowledge also comes acknowledgement. I was aghast; this simply cannot stand! Now that I knew what was stopping my growth, it was time to change some things.</p>
