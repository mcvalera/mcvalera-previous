          <p>I generally avoid any sort of conflict in my life. Past experience has just proven that they were mostly not worth it (I find anger extremely exhausting, for instance), and I'm just not a very aggressive person. There are times, however, where conflict is simply unavoidable. There are topics, for instance, that I feel very strongly about and will fight for. Naturally, the results aren't always pretty.</p>

          <p>The most recent conflict which I've had that stood out to me occured the day before a weekend camping trip with 16 people. I had helped plan the trip--an extremely tedious taks for 16 people--down to food, tent placement, and kayak reservations, and even sent out a detailed itinerary for the weekend several months prior. However, the day before the trip began, two friends were thinking of backing out for several reasons.</p>

          <p>Now, I have to emphasize that their concerns were legitimate, and looking back, I have to laugh at how silly we were for letting it escalate like it did. They had basically agreed to go on the trip but didn't actually read the fine print (hiking 20 miles), and were concerned about nut allergies amidst our food-sharing agreement. Essentially, my friend approached me about her concerns, we both ended up blaming each other for several things, a few hurtful words were exchanged, and by the end I'm pretty sure we were both feeling pretty raw, exhausted and hurt (or at least I know I was).</p>

          <p>I should probably mention that this friend that I fought with was someone that I am very close to, and had known for a good couple of years. Being hurt by someone you don't care too much about? That sucks, but not too bad. Being hurt by and hurting someone you <span class="i">do</span> care about though...that stuff stings. As soon as the situation exploded, the immediate feeling was one of regret, and a lot of telling myself to calm down and to try to extend an apology and meet her somewhere in the middle.</p>

          <p>Anger is never just anger. My anger was brought about a lot of factors other than planning fatigue. I realized that I had already been carrying a little bit of resentment from other times my friend had bailed on me for other things. I realized that I felt neglected and unimportant, that all the work that I put in to plan the trip was inadequate. I realized that I didn't want to have to change anything with the plan and have to re-consult with my co-planner the day before the trip. I realized that I was frustrated in general at how the simplest things all of a sudden were so difficult with more people. Most of all, I realized that I just didn't want to listen to my friend because I was selfish and couldn't see past my own needs, desires and emotions.</p>

          <p>As I tested the waters, I had to bring to mind everything that I knew of my friend, and utilized this knowledge to approach her in a manner that would not be so jarring, especially since this was mere minutes from when we yelled in anger at each other. What's great about this particular friend is that she is very willing to work on relationships if she thinks that it is worth it. We were good enough friends that we wanted to give each other another chance to mend things, raw emotions or no. We talked things out calmly, and by the end we had come to a resolution of sorts. It took a little bit of time before we could be completely normal again, especially once we saw each other. However, I think we could see very clearly that we were both trying to mend things, so that helped tremendously with mending our friendship. I think I can say that this experience made us stronger friends because we now know that even though it can be really difficult sometimes, we both value our friendship enough that we're both willing to put effort to make it work.</p>

          <p>If I could go back in time, I would actually listen to my friend, and evaluate my emotions more clearly. This experience taught me that sometimes I forget to really listen, both to what the other party may be saying, as well as to my own emotions and where they are coming from. My biggest flaw in this particular situation was my selfishness, and I am glad that I know it now so I can try to avoid it in the future.</p>

          <p>In case my friend reads this, I just want to say: "OHAIII! Thanks for being amazing! :3"
