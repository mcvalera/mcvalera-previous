          <p>This week is our first week tackling JavaScript, and it's been an interesting ride so far! I think having learned Ruby prior has really helped me with understanding JavaScript faster than I would otherwise, and for this I am grateful (so don't lose hope if you're struggling to learn your first language! It gets better, I promise). JavaScript is a bit of a strange beast in that it's less picky with your code...something that is both a blessing and a curse. But I'm getting distracted here! Let's talk about looping and how they vary in Ruby and JavaScript.</p>

          <p>A <span id="b">loop</span> is exactly what it sounds like, and in both Ruby and JavaScript, loops are used in order to execute the same block of code a certain number of times until a condition has been satisfied.</p>

          <p>The <span id="b">while</span> loop executes code <span id="i">while</span> a condition is true. The syntax for while loops in Ruby and JavaScript are as follows:</p>

          <pre><code>
            # in Ruby

            while condition do
              code
            end

            # which can be shortened to
            while condition { code }

            ------

            // in JavaScript (note that using "//" is the method to comment in JavaScript)

            while (condition) {
              code
            }
          </code></pre>

          <p>It's much easier to understand when you put actual values in it. Below is an example of the same <code>while</code> loop in both Ruby and JavaScript. The program loops through the code block until the condition <code> x < 5 </code> is met. The code block specifies that <code>x</code> adds 1 to its value, and that we puts out "the variable x is now equal to (the updated value of x)" each time the code is run. Thus we get the results you see below. </p>

          <pre><code>
            # in Ruby

            x = 0           # setting the default value of x to 0

            while x < 5 do
              x += 1        # short for x = x + 1
              puts "the variable x is now equal to #{x}"
            end

            # => "the variable x is now equal to 1"
            # => "the variable x is now equal to 2"
            # => "the variable x is now equal to 3"
            # => "the variable x is now equal to 4"
            # => "the variable x is now equal to 5"

            ------

            // in JavaScript

            var x = 0       # declaring that the variable x is equal to 0

            while (x < 5) {
              x += 1;
              console.log("the variable x is now equal to", x);
            }

            // => "the variable x is now equal to 1"
            // => "the variable x is now equal to 2"
            // => "the variable x is now equal to 3"
            // => "the variable x is now equal to 4"
            // => "the variable x is now equal to 5"
          </code></pre>

          <p>As you can see above, they are pretty similar with minor differences in syntax such as wrapping the condition in parentheses, and I used <code>do</code> and <code>end</code> as opposed to <code>{}</code> for my Ruby portion (although I could have used <code>{}</code> instead). Another difference is using <code>puts</code> in Ruby and <code>console.log</code> in JavaScript. For our purposes, it's enough to know that they do similar things, although they do have their differences as well which I might write about at a different time.</p>

          <p>In contrast, the <span id="b">for</span> loop executes code once for each element in an expression. The syntax for for loops in both Ruby and JavaScript are as follows:</p>

          <pre><code>
            # in Ruby

            for variable in expression do
              code
            end

            # which can be shortened to
            for variable in expression { code }

            ------

            // in JavaScript

            for (variable in object) {
              code
            }
          </code></pre>

          <p>Similar to the <code>while</code> loop above, below is an example of the same <code>for</code> loop in Ruby that is equivalent to the <code>for/in</code> loop in JavaScript.</p>

          <pre><code>
            # in Ruby

            letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
            for x in letters
              puts "#{x}"
            end

            # => a
            # => b
            # => c
            # => d
            # => e

            ------

            // in JavaScript

            var letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"];

            for (x in letters) {
              console.log(letters[x]);
            }

            # => a
            # => b
            # => c
            # => d
            # => e
          </code></pre>

          <p>Both languages above create a variable letters and assign it to an array of the letters a to e, and they both also iterate through each element in an expression/object. The big difference in this particular example, however, is in the line <code>console.log(letters[x])</code> in the JavaScript code. So what's happening here? Well, whereas in Ruby, x refers to the value of the array (i.e. "a", "b", "c"), in JavaScript, x refers for the index of the letters array. If we had just typed in <code>console.log(x)</code> we would've gotten <code>0 1 2 3 4</code> as a result. Typing in <code>(letters[x])</code> however, gives us the values that each index corresponds to. </p>

          <p>I know it might be a bit overwhelming at first, but there's nothing like good ole practice to learn that it's actually fairly straightforward. I hope this is useful!</p>
