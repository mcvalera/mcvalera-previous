        <p>As I tinkered around with CSS a few days ago, I found myself stumped; I was playing with relative and absolute positioning and couldn't figure out how they were different! It was a rather frustrating experience, but now I'm just excited to use my newfound knowledge to make cleaner, more streamlined sites...beginning with this one!</p>

        <p>The <span id="bold">static </span>position is the default position value. This means that it is <span id="i">not </span>positioned in any special way, and thus appears in order of the document flow.</p>

        <!-- p on fixed position -->
        <p></p>

        <!-- p on relative position -->
        <p></p>

        <!-- p on absolute position -->
        <p></p>

        <p>Just in case that didn't help (or even if it did), I suggest watching the video below. It's the single most helpful resource that I have found for differentiating relative and absolute positioning, and I think it would be helpful for you as well!</p>
