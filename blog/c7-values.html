          <p>When I look back and think of all the times I've been at my happiest, proudest or most content, many words come to mind. Some of these words include: accomplishment, close relationships, confidence, enthusiasm, growth, inner harmony, and meaningful work. While I would be lying if I said I lived up to these values all the time, I can at least say that I at least try (although some days are harder than others).</p>

          <p>If I had to pick one from the list that mattered to me the most, I would pick inner harmony. In my experience, it is the hardest on the list to attain. However, the few times I've had it, it has usually meant that I have succeeded in living most of the other values that are important to me. Whenever I experience inner harmony, it means that I am fully and absolutely content with my life at that moment, regardless of all the struggle and uncertainty. It means that I feel loved, that I feel like I am contributing positively to society, that I am happy with the work that I am doing, and that I feel like I am growing to become a person I can be proud of.</p>

          <p>I have been fortunate in life in having so many people that I feel close to, of whom many feel comfortable asking me for advice. Usually, the advice that they seek is of the more personal variety, and thus I don't feel that it is my place to share them. But I can say that I feel al the more honored because these topics tend to be close to the heart--questions of family, relationships, direction, and community.</p>

          <p>Whenever I think about my values or talk to someone else about them, it tends to be noted that my values are less career-oriented and more person-oriented. Values such as competition, leadership or wealth aren't in my list of top priorities, for instance. But to me, that doesn't necessarily translate into not being career-oriented. Instead it just means that I prioritize other aspects of my career, like focusing more on whether I find my work meaningful or if I am passionate about it rather than whether it pays well, or whether I find the work challenging.</p>

          <p>In terms of navigating difficulties in my life, be it personal or otherwise, I definitely think that my values will be extremely beneficial. A lot of my values have to do with being self-aware, and so I think I can feel confident and strong amidst the doubt of others. This is particularly true when such doubts are fueled by stereotypes or things unrelated to my actual performance.</p>

          <p>I am already anticipating that DBC will be tough, and that it will push me probably harder than I have pushed myself before. But whenever I start to feel down (and I know this is likely to happen), I just need to remind myself of my strengths, that I am more resilient than I give myself credit for, and that I have been through tougher things and came out stronger for it (i.e. leaving a whole life behind when my family moved to the US). It is also helpful to remind myself of all the people that are rooting for me to succeed, people that are there to remind me of my capabilities when I do start to doubt myself, and who love me unconditionally. </p>
