          <p>Living in a tech hub like San Francisco, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to observe that the tech industry tends to be comprised of mostly white men. Such observations are confirmed by <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/getting-to-work-on-diversity-at-google.html">diversity reports from tech giants such as Google</a>, whose workforce as of May 2014 was 70% men, 30% women, and 61% white, 30% asian, 3% hispanic, and 2% black.</p>

          <p>At least part of the problem in recruiting women and minorities seems to be that of supply. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_349.asp">women earned only around 18% of all computer science degrees</a> in the United States in the 2010-2011 school year, while blacks and hispanics earned less than 10% of degrees in CS majors.</p>

          <p>The tech industry is an economic driver and has been enjoying increasing influence in society. To lack diversity in this particular industry translates to less ideas and perspectives that you would otherwise get. A room full of white men may not realize that their product is alienating to women or minorities, for example, and the lack of diversity perpetuates the "brogrammer culture" that has <a href="http://www.inc.com/kimberly-weisul/its-the-culture-bro-why-women-leave-tech.html">turned away so many women</a> and other qualified individuals whose backgrounds didn't fit the homogenous status quo.</p>

          <p>Many suggestions have been put forth in order to address this "pipeline problem," but I believe the most effective method is to start computer science education earlier, and to make it integral in our schools. Estonia rolled out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/world/europe/adding-coding-to-the-curriculum.html?_r=1">a countrywide programming-centric curriculum</a> for students as young as six in 2012, so why can't we do the same? Instead of teaching kids how to consume  technology, we should instead teach them how to create technology.</p>

          <p>I didn't attend elementary or high school in the US, so a lot of the public school issues are unfamiliar to me, but as I understand it, some of the difficulties in implementing a programming intensive curriculum stems from limited resources. Struggling public schools may find it difficult to put forth their limited resources towards computer science when their funding depends on their students' success in reading, math or science.</p>

          <p>However, just as literacy in reading and writing has grown to become a necessity in daily life, so too will learning to read, write and understand code in an increasingly tech-reliant world. To have our schools create a strong computer science curriculum will go a long way to ensure that all students--regardless of gender or ethnicity--have a chance to be exposed to programming and the wonders of creating technology.</p>
