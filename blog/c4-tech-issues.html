          <p>Living in a tech hub like San Francisco, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to observe that the tech industry tends to hire mostly white men. Such observations are confirmed by <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/getting-to-work-on-diversity-at-google.html">diversity reports from tech giants such as Google</a>, whose workforce as of May 2014 was 70% men, 30% women, and 61% white, 30% asian, 3% hispanic, and 2% black.</p>

          <p>At least part of the problem in recruiting women and minorities seems to be that of supply. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d12/tables/dt12_349.asp">women earned only around 18% of all computer science degrees</a> in the United States in the 2010-2011 school year, while blacks and hispanics earned less than 10% of degrees in CS majors.</p>

          <p>The tech industry is an economic driver and has been enjoying increasing influence in society. To lack diversity in this particular industry translates to less ideas and perspectives that you would otherwise get. A room full of white men may not realize that their product is alienating to women or minorities, for example, and the lack of diversity perpetuates the "brogrammer culture" that has <a href="http://www.inc.com/kimberly-weisul/its-the-culture-bro-why-women-leave-tech.html">turned away so many women</a>.</p>

          <p>Many suggestions have been put forth in order to address this "pipeline problem," but I believe the most effective method is to start computer science education earlier, and to make it more integral in our schools. Estonia rolled out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/world/europe/adding-coding-to-the-curriculum.html?_r=1">a countrywide programming-centric curriculum</a> for students as young as six in 2012. On the Instead of teaching kids how to consume  technology, they are teaching them how to create technology. Why can't we do the same?</p>
