          <p>If you're reading this around the Thanksgiving holidays, I hope you had a lovely Thanksgiving! In this blog post, we will be looking at Classes in Ruby.</p>

          <p>In essence, a <span class="b">Class</span> allows you to group methods together so that each time you create an object of a class, each object will behave essentially the same way. Below I've created a class called Yearbook (class names are always in CamelCase) with the methods name, birthday, and fave_quote. Note that the variables contained within each method that have the @ symbol are called <span class="b">instance variables</span>. They are different from local variables in that you can access instance variables from other methods.</p>

          <pre><code>
class Yearbook

  # Below is an initialize method
  # It takes in the parameters name, birthday, fave_quote
  def initialize(name, birthday, fave_quote)
    @name = name
    @birthday = birthday
    @fave_quote = fave_quote
  end

  def name
    @name
  end

  def birthday
    @birthday
  end

  def fave_quote
    @fave_quote
  end

end

cvalera = Yearbook.new("Clarisse Valera", "09/08/1988", "Do I dare / Disturb
the universe? / In a minute there is time / For decisions and revisions which
a minute will reverse.")
puts "Name: #{cvalera.name}"
puts "Birthday: #{cvalera.birthday}"
puts "Favorite Quote: #{cvalera.fave_quote}"

# The outcome of the code above is as follows:
=> Name: Clarisse Valera
=> Birthday: 09/08/1988
=> Favorite Quote: Do I dare / Disturb the universe? / In a minute there is
time / For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.
          </code></pre>

          <p>But wait! A lot of that code above is repetitive isn't it? There has to be a way to make it more streamlined isn't there? Why yes, there is! What we need is an attribute. An <span class="b">attribute</span> is a property of an object whose value can be read and/or written through the object. To illustrate, in the code above we can replace our name, birthday, and fave_quote methods with a corresponding attribute reader (written as <span class="i">attr_reader</span>) like so:</p>

          <pre><code>
class Yearbook
attr_reader :name, :birthday, :fave_quote

def initialize(name, birthday, fave_quote)
  @name = name
  @birthday = birthday
  @fave_quote = fave_quote
end

end

# Here, attr_reader :name simply replaces
#  def name
#    @name
#  end
          </code></pre>

          <p>What if I want to add a new field called nickname to my yearbook and I want my program to be able to return it now as well as to change it later on? As you've probably guessed, I would need the attribute reader, but I would also need what is called the attribute writer (written as <span class="i">attr_writer</span>). Similar to the attribute reader, the attribute writer is a stand in for a similar portion of your code. But hey, Ruby has a shortcut for when you need an attribute writer and attribute reader. This is called the attribute accessor (<span class="i">attr_accessor</span>)!</p>

          <pre><code>
attr_reader :nickname
# Replaces the following code block:
# def nickname
#   @nickname
# end

attr_writer :nickname
# Replaces the following code block:
# def nickname(string)
#   @nickname = string
# end

attr_accessor :nickname
# Replaces both of the above code blocks
          </code></pre>

          <p>Considering all of these shortcuts and my newfound desire to add a nickname method that I can modify, how would I then write my code for my Yearbook class?</p>

          <pre><code>
class Yearbook
attr_reader :name, :birthday, :fave_quote
attr_accessor :nickname

  def initialize(name, birthday, fave_quote)
    @name = name
    @birthday = birthday
    @fave_quote = fave_quote
  end
  # Note that the nickname variable is not included in the initialize method because inthis case I want to assign/reassign our nickname method outside of the initialize method

end

# The nickname given to me as a baby
cvalera.nickname = "Clang-Clang"
puts "Nickname: #{cvalera.nickname}"

# The nickname I now go by
cvalera.nickname = "Clang"
puts "Nickname: #{cvalera.nickname}"

=> Nickname: Clang-Clang
=> Nickname: Clang
          </code></pre>

          <p>That's really all there is to creating basic classes in Ruby! Try it out for yourself, experiment a bit, and have fun!</p>
