          <!--  Begin typing post below -->
          <p> This week has been all about Ruby in the Dev Bootcamp world. It's been a few months since I've flexed my Ruby muscles properly, and man, I have a lot of reading and studying to do!</p>

          <p>This particular post will be on arrays and hashes. What are these things, you ask? Well, to put it quite simply, they're like containers that store things.</p>

          <p>An <span id="b">array</span> is an ordered collection of objects. It is integer-indexed, which means that each slot or object contained in the array is given an index number, beginning with 0.Each index corresponds to a slot in the array.</p>

          <pre><code>
            []                       # an empty array
            [5, 'elephant', [1,2]]   # an array holding an integer, a string and an array
          </code></pre>

          <p>You can see how the numeric index works to point to a slot in an array below:</p>

          <pre><code>
            fruits = ['mango', 'banana', 'orange', 'papaya']
              #an array called 'fruits' holding 4 strings

            puts fruits[0]  #=> 'mango'
            puts fruits[1]  #=> 'banana'
            puts fruits[2]  #=> 'orange'
            puts fruits[3]  #=> 'papaya'
            print fruits    #=> 'mango, banana, orange, papaya'
          </code></pre>

          <p>As a reminder, the command <code>print</code> just tells the computer to print out something to the console without adding a newline, while <code>puts</code> essentially tells the computer to print something out to the console and then adds a newline after executing the command (newline is really just like pressing enter on the keyboard to get to the next line). In the above example, we used <code>puts fruits[0] </code>to puts out the <span id="i">first </span>fruit in the array, <code>puts fruits[1]</code> to puts out the <span id="i">second</span> fruit in the array, and so on and so forth.</p>

          <p>For our purposes, there are two basic ways to create an array (although there are really more ways to do so out in the world). The first, which I used in the above examples, is to use the literal constructor []. The second is to use Array.new as you can see below.</p>

          <pre><code>
            Array.new               # an empty, unnamed array, similar to just []
            Array.new(20)           # an unnamed array with a size of 20 elements
            fruits = Array.new      # an empty array called 'fruits'
            fruits = Array.new(4)   # an array called 'fruits' with 4 elements
          </code></pre>

          <p><span id="b">Hashes</span> are a collection of unique keys and their values. They are similar to arrays, except instead of being integer-indexed, hashes allow you to use any kind of object to refer to a corresponding value. You can create a blank hash by using two curly braces <code>{}</code>, or to make a hash that is populated, you may do something like this:</p>

          <pre><code>
            birthdays = {
              'mom' => 'March 15',
              'dad' => 'September 23',
              'brother' => 'June 24',
              'sister' => 'October 31',
              'me' => 'September 8'
            }
          </code></pre>

          <p>In the above example, the names are the 'keys' while the birthdays are the 'values.' We are able to retrieve values from a hash by using the [] operator and enclosing the key within it. For example, if we wanted to find when my mom's birthday was, we would have to type in <code>birthdays['mom']</code>.</p>

          <p>...Aaaaand that's all there really is to making arrays and hashes! Not too bad right? Or course, there are other method of creating them and working with them that I did not include here, but really, as an introduction, I would say that this pretty much covers it. Try it out for yourself and let me know how you find it! :D </p>
