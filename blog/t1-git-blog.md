# Version Control:

## Git, GitHub and the Beauty of Commiting

**October 30, 2014**

Now, I am not what you would call a *gamer*, but I have watched my share of games growing up. When I say "watched," I don't just mean casually glancing at people playing games. What I mean is that I stayed up for 24 hours straight or however long it took, watching my brother play Final Fantasy VIII. The story was just so good, the game itself was exciting, and well...I was a **huge** sucker for the Squall-and-Rinoa awkward romance (and the incredibly amazing soundtrack). What does this have to do with the supposed topic at hand? Well, not much really. Except for a single aspect: checkpoints. I actually think they might have been called "Save Points" in Final Fantasy VIII, but I digress. What I am trying to say is that version control is a lot like these save points. Save points save exactly where you are in the game, along with your current health status, items obtained, and every experience point gained from slaying bad guys along the way. Similarly, having version control means that you essentially save a snapshot of your code at a particular point in time. It's handy for a multitude of reasons, not least of which is that it acts as a backup should you decide that you need to do things over from a certain point.

This is where git comes in. Git is the program through which you are able to save these screenshots of your code at different times.
