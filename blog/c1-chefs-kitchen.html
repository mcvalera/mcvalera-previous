          <p>I recently watched a Fireside Chat with Dev Bootcamp founder, Shereef Bishay. In the chat, he spoke of how Dev Bootcamp came about, his motivations for starting it, the kind of students they are looking for, their expectations, and the general learning environment at DBC, among other things.</p>

          <p>I am now coming to the end of my first week of Phase 0 at DBC and this experience, combined with what I've learned during the Fireside Chat has given me a few impressions and insights.</p>

          <p>First of all, Dev Bootcamp is tough. It takes up a lot of time, it's mentally and physically taxing (oh the eye strain!), and the curriculum is gruelling. That said, it has thus far been the most intellectually fun (and rewarding) experience that I have had since finals week during my days at UC Berkeley, running on a few hours of sleep and writing back-to-back 20-page essays. The most surprising thing to me is that I missed that kind of pressure at all. In the very laidback years since college, I had forgotten that I thrived working in that environment--at least for the two-week-long spans of time that I have experienced it prior. Dev Bootcamp is 19 weeks from start to finish though, so we'll see where I'm at a few more weeks in.</p>

          <p>What seems to set DBC apart from the other coding bootcamps out there seems to be its emphasis on not just honing your intellect and coding prowess, but also making sure that the rest of the package is doing well also. They aren't out to just make amazing developers, they're out to hone amazing developers that are compassionate and kind and full of integrity. Developers that are passionate about what they do and are driven to succeed. They don't really care if you haven't graduated college, or if you've spent the past 3 years bartending after your BA didn't work out like you thought it would. They understand that brilliance can be found everywhere, that the world is a tough place, and that what matters in the end of the day is the strength of your character and your potential for being a brilliant developer.</p>

          <p>They offer something exciting: a chance to better your situation through a career in tech, surrounded by a tight-knit group of similarly determined people. It's only been a week and members of my cohort (Squirrels!) from San Francisco, New York and Chicago have already shown that they can be helpful, resourceful, and sometimes even funny.</p>

          <p>I can't begin to describe how exciting this is for me, and I only hope that I can maintain this optimism throughout my time at Dev Bootcamp.</p>
