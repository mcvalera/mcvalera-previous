          <p>One of the primary things that I have learned to contend with over the previous couple weeks has been the importance of variable scope. <span class="b">Scope</span> just refers to how visible identifiers such as variables are, and which methods or classes can access them.</p>

          <p>This week at DBC, we were briefly exposed to five types of variables: Global, Constant, Class, Instance, and Local.</p>

          <p>A global scope is a scope that covers the entire program. Global variables have global scope, and are identified with a $ character. Global variables are accessible in any class or method within the program and thus are simply never out of scope.</p>

          <pre><code>
$global_var = "I am a global variable!"

class ClassName
  def access_global
    puts $global_var
  end
end

test = ClassName.new
test.access_global

=> "I am a global variable!"
          </code></pre>

          <p>Constants are identified by being UPCASE. They can be defined within class and method definitions, and can be accessed from anywhere provided that the user is familiar with the order of nested definitions. In that sense, constants seem to have a scope that is similar to global--as long as you know the path. Note, however, that in the constants X below, the constant in one scope is not the same as the constant X in the other.</p>

          <pre><code>
class A
  class B
    X = 1
    class C
      X = 5
    end
  end
end

puts A::B::X => 1
puts A::B::C::X => 2
          </code></pre>

          <p>Class variables are easily identifiable in that they are always preceded by two @@ symbols. They are not class scoped as the name would suggest, but are instead class-hierarchy scoped. What this means is that they are shared across <span class="i">all instances</span> of a class, as well as outside of a class.</p>

          <pre><code>
class NameLength
  @@length = 0

  def initialize(name)
    @@length = name.length
    puts "Your name is #{@@length} characters long!"
  end
end

first_name = NameLength.new("Clarisse")
=> "Your name is 8 characters long!"
          </code></pre>

          <p>Instance variables, on the other hand, can only be accessed within any instance of a class but not outside of the class. The scope of an instance variable is such that they are only accessible to methods within the same class. Instance variables are always preceded by a single @ symbol.</p>

          <pre><code>
class Yearbook

  def initialize(name, birthday, fave_quote)
    @name = name
    @birthday = birthday
    @fave_quote = fave_quote
  end

  def name
    @name
  end

  def birthday
    @birthday
  end

  def fave_quote
    @fave_quote
  end

end

cvalera = Yearbook.new("Clarisse Valera", "09/08/1988", "Do I dare / Disturb
the universe? / In a minute there is time / For decisions and revisions which
a minute will reverse.")
puts "Name: #{cvalera.name}"
puts "Birthday: #{cvalera.birthday}"
puts "Favorite Quote: #{cvalera.fave_quote}"

# The outcome of the code above is as follows:
=> Name: Clarisse Valera
=> Birthday: 09/08/1988
=> Favorite Quote: Do I dare / Disturb the universe? / In a minute there is
time / For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.
          </code></pre>

          <p>Local variables have the most limited scope and are only accessible within a method. Because of this, local variables of the same name within different methods in a class can have different values.</p>

          <pre></code>
class SiblingBirthdays

  def personal_info
    name = "Clarisse"
    birthday = "09/08/1988"
    puts "Name: #{name}, Birthday: #{birthday}"
  end

  def brothers_info
    name = "John"
    birthday = "06/24/85"
    puts "Name: #{name}, Birthday: #{birthday}"

  end

  def sisters_info
    name = "Trina"
    birthday = "10/31/86"
    puts "Name: #{name}, Birthday: #{birthday}"
  end

end

test = SiblingBirthdays.new
test.personal_info

=> Name: Clarisse, Birthday: 09/08/88
test.brothers_info
=> Name: John, Birthday: 06/24/85
test.sisters_info
=> Name: Trina, Birthday: 10/31/86
          </code></pre>

          <p>There's more to variable scope and the above mentioned variables that even I don't know yet, but it seems to me so far that this is a good place to start! As always, try it out for yourself, and I hope this post was illuminating!</p>
