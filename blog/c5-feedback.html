          <p>My initial response to pairing was one tinged by skepticism. In the past, I have tended to prefer going the lone wolf route when trying to accomplish certain tasks. However, 5 weeks in and 10 pairings later, I can appreciate the pairing process and I have found it to be beneficial to both my learning and the way I relate to other people.</p>

          <p>Pairing tends to start off a little awkwardly as each person tries to gauge where their pair is at (mentally, emotionally, physically), how their day has been thus far, and whether or not s/he would like to drive or navigate or do a combination of both. In practice, pairing for me has been an experiment in getting into someone else's head and trying to figure out the best way to work with them and their needs. Depending on the person and the difficulty level of the challenge involved, some pairing sessions may be easier or harder than others.</p>

          <p>The best part of pairing is when you feel totally on the same page with another person; you're both enthusiastic, communicative, comfortable and respectful, and you just push each other to create better code. I think I've been fortunate in having had that kind of pairing a few times now, so I feel pretty lucky. It just feels really good to be so productive with another person that's equally as driven as you are.</p>

          <p>Of course, it's not all sunshine and flowers. I've had pairs where the lack of enthusiasm was infectious, or the challenge's level of difficulty was very discouraging, and even ones where I felt terribly inadequate because I couldn't contribute as much as I would like. Of these, the worst for me is the last situation, but again, thankfully, I have thus far paired with individuals that are ridiculously patient </p>
