          <p>My initial response to pairing was one tinged by skepticism. In the past, I have tended to prefer going the lone wolf route when trying to accomplish certain tasks. However, 5 weeks in and 11 pairings later, I can appreciate the pairing process and I have found it beneficial to both my learning and the way I relate to other people.</p>

          <p>Pairing tends to start off a little awkwardly as each person tries to gauge where their pair is at (mentally, emotionally, physically), how their day has been thus far, and whether or not s/he would like to drive or navigate or do a combination of both. In practice, pairing for me has been an experiment in getting into someone else's head and trying to figure out the best way to work with them and their needs. Depending on the person and the difficulty level of the challenge involved, some pairing sessions may be easier or harder than others.</p>

          <p>The best part of pairing is when you feel totally on the same page with another person; you're both enthusiastic, communicative, comfortable and respectful, and you just push each other to create better code. I think I've been fortunate in having had that kind of pairing a few times now, so I feel pretty lucky. It just feels really good to be so productive with another person that's equally as driven as you are.</p>

          <p>Of course, it's not all sunshine and flowers. I've had pairs where the lack of enthusiasm was infectious, or the challenge's level of difficulty was very discouraging, and even ones where I felt terribly inadequate because I couldn't contribute as much as I would like. Of these, the worst for me is the last situation, but again, thankfully, I have thus far paired with individuals that are ridiculously patient and kind.</p>

          <p>"Kind." I've probably gone years at a time without hearing that word once, and yet it has been part of my everyday life since DBC began. It is particularly emphasized in the Feedback Dashboard wherein we provide feedback to individuals we have paired with. It is just woven into the fabric of DBC's culture to be kind to oneself and others, and when giving others with feedback, we are always asked to provide ones that are "<span class="b">A</span>ctionable <span class="b">S</span>pecific and <span class="b">K</span>ind."</p>

          <p>I used to think of it as kind of funny because it is harped on so much at the beginning, but I now see why it's so important. Reading the feedback given to me is actually a useful thing. Instead of getting a generic, "Hey, awesome job!" or (god forbid) "You were awful today," the feedback that I get tells me exactly what I did right and what exactly I should change in a tone that is respectful, honest, and...well, <span class="i">kind</span>.</p>

          <p>I can tell from the collection of feedback that I've received that while I am good at listening, communicating, and bringing enthusiasm and a sense of humor into a pair, I am pretty awful at sticking to driver/navigator roles, I don't pseudocode enough, and sometimes I just barrel into a problem without reading all the directions prior (I'm working on it). But what's cool about getting feedback every week from different people is that I can kind of use it to track my progress with regard to being a good pair. Thankfully, I don't hear about my inability to stick to a driver/navigator role as much, and I read directions more thoroughly now, so I know I'm progressing on those aspects.</p>

          <p>Similarly, when writing feedback, I always make sure to write something actionable since I know that there's always something we can all do better, regardless of how well the pairing session went. I try to include as much detail as possible with regards to what went well and what didn't, but most of all, I put myself in the position of the person I am writing feedback for and think of how I might phrase things for maximum effect in a considerate fashion.</p>

          <p>What I love about my experience in Dev Bootcamp so far is the fact that it feels like such a tight-knit community where your peers and your guides all feel like they're rooting for you. In the real world, I'm not sure where I might find the kind of patience that my peers display when their pairs are struggling with code, or that sense of camaraderie when each pair pushes the other to tackle a problem in a more efficient manner. It is frankly a beautiful thing to be a part of, and it's these things that help keep me fighting whenever I feel like I'm falling behind.</p>
