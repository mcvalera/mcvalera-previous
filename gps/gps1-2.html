        <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
        <p>
            Pair programming is when two people work together as a team.
            They usually decide how they want to work together in terms of driving and navigating.
        </p>
        <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
        <p>
            Because one person doesn't know all the answers and it's good to work as a team.
            As a navigator, it helps to cement your learnings by teaching it to someone else,
            and as driver you can learn how other people think through things, and it teaches you patience.
            It prepares you for the workplace in that you learn how to work in a team.
        </p>
        <h3>Compare driver and navigator.</h3>
        <p>
            The driver is the person who is hands on with the programming,
            while the navigator acts as a guide.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          As a prologue, I just want to say that I have been advised to write about this pairing session as opposed to my first pairing session.

          It was fun bouncing ideas off of someone during our pairing session. We didn't really switch driver and navigator roles (I was driving the whole time), but I still got to put in my ideas and felt that I was heard, so that was great!
